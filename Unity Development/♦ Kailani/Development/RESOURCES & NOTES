Updating GitHub branches

SET UP
  cd...
  git clone https://github.com/scoobz1234/AIProduction.git
  cd AIProduction (make sure you're in the desired clone)
  git checkout xxx (make sure you're accessing the desired branch)

FIRST CHECK
  git status (make sure it's checking the right folder)
  git remote -v (Is it recognizing the appropriate repo?)

MAKE ADJUSTMENTS LOCALLY

PREP ADDJUSTMENTS TO BE ADDED
  git add .
  git commit -m "commitMessage"
  git push origin xxx
  
  ////////////////////////////////////////

Production Weeklies:
* touch base w/ Thea regarding production at least twice a week outside of class
* ensure GitHub is updated
* ensure GDD is current
* submit (programming) work hours to Stephen
* submit (producer) work hours
* gently remind team members to take breaks as necessary
* upload programming assignments Saturday
* upload UI sprite assignments Saturday (if any)

Things I'd like to improve on:
* fine-tuning deliverables
* more consistently updating GitHub & Google Drive
* delegating tasks & saying no
* being more assertive
* being more transparent to the non-programming team about programming intentions
* more regularly checking-in to all team mates to provide moral support as necessary
* helping build team confidence & efficiency
* try to spend less than 6 hours in a single day working on assignments related to this class
