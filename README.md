# Sound FX

VR&R Game Production Team

### About this Branch

Audible assets are stored here with the intention of incorporating them into the simulation. This particar branch is slightly different than most asset branches -- it's primarily being used as a sound library.

NEW 7/1/2018 After carefully considering the workflow during Game Pre-Production, individual files are now active in order to improve our team production efforts. Individual files are meant to improve 2 primary areas:

1. Focus
It's easy to get lost with all the resources and assets bouncing around throughout development. This hopefully gives team members a definite space for themselves within the repository.

2. Accountability
This is meant to provide a more evident visual for contributions made in this particular branch. It's intended to help peers gauge their output and adjust as necessary, whether that means picking up the slack or slowing down and delegating assignments.

Unlike other asset branches, there are not "Completed" or "Development" folders. Upload your audio files into your designated folder. These files will be reviewed by **Haneen** for final approval. She'll be integrating the approved files into the `Unity Source File` branch.


### Audio Resources

Resources will be listed below for convenience after Production starts. This list will continue to grow as necessary.
