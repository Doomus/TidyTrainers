# Modeling, Texturing, and Animation

VR&R Game Production Team

Lead: Toby

Second: Dominique

### About this Branch

This particular branch is designated for 3D assets. The folders contain the following content:

> Models

These contain completed filmbox (.fbx) assets that are intended to be incorporated into the simulation. .fbx files stored here indicate that the model is ready to be passed to the programming team.

This means that either **Toby or Dominique** have deemed, at the bare minimum, that the model is in a finished state:

* geometry appears visually complete
* UV maps are setup for texture artists

The following are not necessary for initial integration approval, and are encouraged to be added as they are completed later down the line:

* complete texture sets (albedo/transparency, ambient occlusion, metallic/smoothness, normal)
* rigs and animations

> Team Member Files

**NEW 7/1/2018**
After carefully considering the workflow during Game Pre-Production, individual files are now active in order to improve our team production efforts. Individual files are meant to improve 2 primary areas:

1. Focus

It's easy to get lost with all the resources and assets bouncing around throughout development. This hopefully gives team members a definite space for themselves within the repository.

2. Accountability

This is meant to provide a more evident visual for contributions made in this particular branch. It's intended to help peers gauge their output and adjust as necessary, whether that means picking up the slack or slowing down and delegating assignments.

**ONLY UPLOAD ASSETS READY TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE TIDY TRAINERS APPLICATION**

### Naming Conventions

Clean, consistent naming conventions decreases time spent searching for assets and saves both valueable time and energy for the team as a whole. Help us out by following the approved conventions below:

> Models (Filmbox/.fbx) Files

assetName_additionAssetDescriptionIfNecessary_Version.fbx

examples: bathroomCabinet_Counter_1, bathroomDoor_1, sprayBottle_1, bathroomLights_1, bathroomTutorialScene_1, mirror_1

> Texture (Targa/.tga) files

assetName_additionAssetDescriptionIfNecessary_Version_TextureType.tga

examples: bathroomCounter_1_AO.tga, cleaningCaddy_1_AlbedoTransparency.tga, mirror_1_Normal.tga, rag_1_MetallicSmoothness.tga

**ADDITIONAL NOTES**

*While it might seem odd to note version 1 per item, the unforeseeable future might warrant us to create another version of the same object. While we can't account for everything, it is nice to be prepared. Thus bear with the convention and remember to add the appropriate version number.*
