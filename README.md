# UI Design
VR&R Game Production Team

### About this Branch

This branch is intended to contain user interface assets in addition to user experience notes. The folders contain the following:

>In-Class Discussions

These contain records of the design concepts discussed amongst the UI/UX team. These are whiteboard images, notes, and any additional collaborative design efforts conducted in-class.

>UserInterface

These are visual portable network graphics (.png) assets that are intended to be integrated into the simulation.

**NEW 7/1/2018** After carefully considering the workflow during Game Pre-Production, individual files are now active in order to improve our team production efforts. Individual files are meant to improve 2 primary areas:

1. Focus
It's easy to get lost with all the resources and assets bouncing around throughout development. This hopefully gives team members a definite space for themselves within the repository.

2. Accountability
This is meant to provide a more evident visual for contributions made in this particular branch. It's intended to help peers gauge their output and adjust as necessary, whether that means picking up the slack or slowing down and delegating assignments.

Additionally, each team file contains two standard folders: `♥ Completed` and `Development`.

The first contains sprites ready for integration. Going forward into the remaining production period, these require approval from **Thea** before being uploaded to the `♥ Completed` folder, in addition to feedback from at least 2 other people. This can be another team member or third-party consultants. 

`Development`, on the other hand, contains composites and whatever assets or resources you deem necessary (photoshop files, illusrator files, sketches, references, notes, etc). Be sure to upload composites (design proposals/concepts) to your personal `Development` folder ***and*** Discord.

### Naming Conventions

Clean, consistent naming conventions decreases time spent searching for assets and saves both valueable time and energy for the team as a whole. Help us out by following the approved conventions below:

> Sprites(Portable Network Graphics/.png)

category_assetName_Version.png

ex: checklist_kitchenSink_1.png, wristband_clipboard_1.png, screen_warning_1.png

`note: name of asset, camelcase; asset number, starting at 1

note: size 500px * 500px or larger
`
