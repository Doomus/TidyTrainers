Unreal and Unity Comparison
FEEL FREE TO ADD *YOUR* INPUT!

# Performance
## Language
C++ generally communicates faster with the system, but is a more complex language. 
C# is generally easier to comprehend from a developer's point of view, but might not be as quick as C++.

## Visuals
Unreal undoubtly has a superior "out of the box" lighting environment. (V-Ray results are stunning)
Unity can also achieve visually spectacularly environments, but require additional effort.

Unreal's shader and particle system is especially powerful.

## VR_Engine_Optimization
Unreal focuses more on optimization in VR than Unity. UE has built-in VR editors.
Unity requires the acquisition of outside plug-ins, but they're often easy to find.

Unreal build sizes tend to be large. A blank project will tend to build at a minimum of 200MB.
Unity's environment building isn't on par with Unreal's (grid snapping, complex in-scene model editing, etc).

## Development_Outlook
Some classify Unreal as a "AAA engine".
Unity is often viewed as a "indie engine".

## Editor_Tools
Unreal is fairly easy to pick up given a background in 3D sculpting software.
Unity's modular system allows for quicker prototyping. It also allows for greater ease-of-access for control over custom forms, editor interfaces, and tools.

## Familiarity
Of our 6 team programmers, 3 tend to lean towards Unreal while 3 tend to lean towards Unreal.

## Documentation
Resources for both engines are fairly comprehensive. Unreal tends to have more comprehensive blueprint resources than C++ scripting, but the resources are available nonetheless.
Unity documentation and resources are insanely extensive. 

Additionally, the current game programming instructor has a greater knowledge pool of Unity than Unreal.
