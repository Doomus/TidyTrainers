# Unreal and Unity Comparison
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO ADD BOTH *YOUR* RESEARCH RESOURCES & INPUT!

## Performance
> Unreal
* C++ generally communicates faster with the system, but is a more complex language. 

## Language
> Unity
* C# is generally easier to comprehend from a developer's point of view, but might not be as quick as C++.

## Visuals
> Unreal
* Unreal undoubtly has a superior "out of the box" lighting environment. (V-Ray results are stunning)
* Unity requires additional effort to achieve Unreal's level of visuals.
* Unreal's shader and particle system is especially powerful.

## VR Engine Optimization
> Unreal
* Unreal focuses more on optimization in VR than Unity. UE has built-in VR editors.
* Unity requires the acquisition of outside plug-ins, but they're often easy to find.

Unreal build sizes tend to be large. A blank project will tend to build at a minimum of 200MB.
Unreal's default environment building tools are more extensive than Unity's (grid snapping, complex in-scene model editing, etc).

## Development Reputation
> Team Preference
* Some classify Unreal as a "AAA engine" and is often viewed as designer-oriented.
* Unity is often viewed as a "indie engine" and is often viewed as programmer-oriented.

## Editor & Tools
> Unity
* Unreal is fairly easy to pick up given a background in 3D sculpting software.
* Unity's modular system allows for quicker prototyping. It also allows for greater ease-of-access for control over custom forms, editor interfaces, and tools.
* Unreal's editor is considered slow in comparison to other engines (opening projects, rebuilding shaders, updating references, calculating lightmaps, etc.)

## Familiarity
> Team Preference
* Of our 6 team programmers, 3 tend to lean towards Unreal while 3 tend to lean towards Unreal.
* Art team has greater familiarity with Unreal; lacks sufficient training in Unity
* Current game programming instructor has a greater knowledge pool of Unity than Unreal

## Documentation
> Unity
* Resources for both engines are fairly comprehensive. Unreal tends to have more comprehensive blueprint resources than C++ scripting, but the resources are available nonetheless.
* Unity documentation and resources are insanely extensive.
