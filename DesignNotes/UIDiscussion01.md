# UI Discussion 01 (week 04) | 23 April 2018
The following is a record of the UI & UX concepts discussed during our week 4 class session. For additional clarification, ask Dasha, Kailani, Patron, Stephen, or Thea.

## Menus
### Main Menu
► UI elements floating in space
► Reach out and touch to interact with menu elements
**Intention: Reinforce the concept of VR space through early menu interactions**

► visible objectives list
► list elements removed upon completion
**Intention: Allows access to useful task completion information**

### Game Statistics Menu(s)
► mimic wristwatch/wristband set-up
► wrist down: display wristwatch with basic stat(s) (elapsed time)
► wrist up: display wristband options (tap to produce and toggle a clipboard)
**Intention: To provide access to additional menus in a familiar wrist accessory**

**clipboard:**
* aesthetic mix between traditional and holographic
* displays checklist
* double sided -- additional useful info
* trainees can grip and turn object within the world space
* pin & move
**Intention: To provide access to objects while in the training space in a familiar fashion**

## Visual Guides
### Interactions & Intended Results
► holographic (shader) overlays indicating intended interactions and results
► blue: pre-attempt hints/intentions
► green: successfully executed
► yellow: almost (requires minor adjustments)
► red: hasn’t quite reached the necessary standards (failed attempt)
Examples: If placing towels, indicate holographic outline of intended stack size and placement. If parking cart, provide an overlay of where the cart ought to be.

### Proximity Specific Details
► in-world UI visible within proximity (collision detection)
► UI indicating different room spaces
► possibly fade in and out
