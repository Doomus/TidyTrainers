# UI Discussion 01 (week 04) | 23 April 2018
The following is a record of the UI & UX concepts discussed during our week 4 class session. For additional clarification, ask Dasha, Kailani, Patron, Stephen, or Thea.

## Menus
### Main Menu
* UI elements floating in space
* Reach out and touch to interact with menu elements
* **Intention: Reinforce the concept of VR space through early menu interactions**
* visible objectives list
* list elements removed upon completion
* **Intention: Allows access to useful task completion information**

### Game Statistics Menu(s)
* mimic wristwatch/wristband set-up
* wrist down: display wristwatch with basic stat(s) (elapsed time)
* wrist up: display wristband options (tap to produce and toggle a clipboard)
* **Intention: To provide access to additional menus in a familiar wrist accessory**

**clipboard:**
* aesthetic mix between traditional and holographic
* displays checklist
* double sided -- additional useful info
* trainees can grip and turn object within the world space
* pin & move
* **Intention: To provide access to objects while in the training space in a familiar fashion**

**accessible statistics & info:**
* time (elpased)
* efficiency counter (How may times did you request hints? How many times did you pass through a room?)
* objective checklists (clipboard)
* current room (indication for better room orientation)
* notable labels (floating UI, visible when within proximity): toxic chemicals, attention, etc

## Visual Guides
### Interactions & Intended Results
* holographic (shader) overlays indicating intended interactions and results
* blue: pre-attempt hints/intentions
* green: successfully executed
* yellow: almost (requires minor adjustments)
* red: hasnâ€™t quite reached the necessary standards (failed attempt)
* red overlay to discourage behaviors such as spraying cleaning chemicals into your face
* **Examples: If placing towels, indicate holographic outline of intended stack size and placement. If parking cart, provide an overlay of where the cart ought to be.**

### Proximity Specific Details
* in-world UI visible within proximity (collision detection)
* UI indicating different room spaces
* possibly fade in and out

> Additional Notes for non-User-Interface-related ideas.

* vibration feedback (provides more tactile experience)
* Haptic Glove (pressure feedback)
* Carrying multiple items: load and tote items in a basket
* efficiency assessment: lock or lose efficiency when leaving a room too early without 100% completion
* Did I finish? Did every task get addressed? --> How will this information be presented?
* controller note: just because the buttons are there, doesn't mean we're obligated to use them all
* movement: cast & move; blink; to be discussed as a class later
* stick your hand into a socket --> CONFETTI!
